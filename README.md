## 🏆 Scoring System (How Points Are Calculated)  
Each participant earns points based on the following criteria:

| Criteria                        | Points Awarded |
|--------------------------------|---------------|
| Daily Problem Submission       | **+10** per day  |
| Solving Medium Difficulty      | **+5** bonus  |
| Solving Hard Difficulty        | **+10** bonus  |
| Code Quality (Linting Check)   | **+5** per problem  |
| Early Submission (Before 6 PM) | **+2** bonus  |

### **Example Calculation:**  
- **Day 1:** Submitted a **Medium** problem before 6 PM with good code quality.  
  ✅ **10 (submission) + 5 (medium bonus) + 5 (code quality) + 2 (early submission) = 22 Points**  
- **Day 2:** Submitted a **Hard** problem, but failed linting.  
  ✅ **10 (submission) + 10 (hard bonus) = 20 Points**  
- **Total after 2 days:** **42 Points**  

📌 **Top 3 scorers after 100 days will be the winners!**
