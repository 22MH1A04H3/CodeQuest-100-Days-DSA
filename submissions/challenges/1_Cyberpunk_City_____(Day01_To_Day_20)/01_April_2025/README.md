# **Day 1: The Awakening**  

## **🌆 Story Context**  
You wake up in a **cyberpunk city** with no memory of who you are. Neon lights flicker, and the hum of drones fills the air. An AI named **Echo** introduces itself as your guide.  

> **Echo:** "Welcome, coder. The city is under attack by **The Glitch**. We need your help to fix the corrupted systems and escape before it’s too late."  

---

## **🎯 Today’s Mission**  
Your first task is to fix a **broken program** that prints a message. This will help Echo regain its functionality and guide you through the city.  

---

## **📝 Challenge**  
Write a program that prints:  
Hello, World!

---

## **💡 Tips**  
1. Use the **print statement** in your preferred programming language.  
2. Run the program to see the output.  

---

## **📂 Submission Instructions**  
1. Navigate to the `submissions/YourName/Day-1/` folder.  
2. Add your solution file (e.g., `solution.py`, `solution.c`, `solution.cpp`, `solution.java`).  
3. Optionally, add a `notes.txt` file to explain your approach.  

---

## **🌟 Pro Tip**  
Use **emojis** in your code comments to make your solutions more fun! For example:  
```python
# 🌟 My first program in the cyberpunk city! 🌟
print("Hello, World!")
😂 Echo’s Dad Joke of the Day
Echo: "Why do programmers prefer dark mode? Because light attracts bugs! 🐛"

🚀 Let’s Begin!
Good luck, coder! Fix the program and help Echo guide you through the city. 🚀
